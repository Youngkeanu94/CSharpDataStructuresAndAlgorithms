This C# program is a multifaceted demonstration of data structure manipulation and traversal techniques. It's organized into three distinct sections, each focusing on different data structures and algorithms.

Section 1: Array and Set Operations
This part illustrates the conversion of an array of mammal names into a HashSet to ensure uniqueness, followed by a transformation into a SortedSet for ordering. It showcases basic array handling and advanced set operations.

Section 2: List Management
Here, the focus shifts to list operations. The section begins by creating and displaying a list of friends with their contact details, then sorts this list. It further demonstrates how to remove specific items from the list, including the first, second, and last entries, before displaying the final list and its count.

Section 3: Binary Tree Implementation and Traversal
The final section introduces a basic binary tree implementation, including node insertion and tree traversal. It covers the three primary tree traversal methods: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
